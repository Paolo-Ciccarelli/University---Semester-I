	 * This program calculates an individual's BMI according to their weight (in
	 * kilograms) and height (in meters). The instructor-provided formula used for
	 * BMI computations is: weight / (height * height). The BMI value computed will
	 * subsequently be categorized among four different categories: "underweight"
	 * for BMI less than 18.5, "normal weight" for BMI between 18.5 and 24.9,
	 * "overweight" for BMI between 25 and 29.9, and "obesity" for BMI 30 or
	 * greater. Finally, users may query the program for advice should they choose
	 * so.
