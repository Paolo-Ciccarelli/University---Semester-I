		   The strategy here was to create a new string called "solution" with equal length to the "puzzle" string above, albeit completely filled with blanks.
		   
		   The "answer" string was created by gradually concatenating various portions of the "solution" string.
           Sections of the "solution" string were concatenated up until the index where an '@' character existed in the original "puzzle" string.
           The corresponding algorithm solution would then be added at that index.
           From then on the above steps would repeat, the only differences being the indexes of the concatenated string and the algorithm solution inserted.
           Regardless of the values of a,b,c,d,e,f this algorithm ensures that the instructed format is always maintained. */
